### Reflections and Comments

I felt pretty good about what we went over today. I have seen Conditionals, Logical Operators, Expressions, and Statements in the class before this, and so it was nice to have this day to refresh on those. I am definitely still learning what all these mean, and I plan to learn to hold onto that information better over time.
